#  This is my first project that I have applied my skills to from the Hyperion Bootcamp. It is not perfect, and I expect to improve this skill the more I expose myself to self guided challenges
# The aim of this is to showcase evidence of my progress and how I implement skills like data cleaning and manipulation in order to predict the car price.
